          Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. After graduating from Columbia
          University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In
          1988, he enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black
          president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a
          civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at
          the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning to
          elective politics, he represented the 13th district in the Illinois
          Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama
          received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate primary win,
          his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address,
          and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, a year
          after beginning his campaign, and after a close primary campaign
          against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for
          president. Obama was elected over Republican nominee John McCain in
          the general election and was inaugurated alongside his running mate
          Joe Biden, on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the
          2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, a decision that drew a mixture of
          praise and criticism.Obama signed many landmark bills into law during
          his first two years in office. The main reforms include: the
          Affordable Care Act, sometimes referred to as "the ACA" or
          "Obamacare", the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
          Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American
          Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance
          Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act served as economic stimuli
          amidst the Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national
          debt limit, he signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer
          Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in
          Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia New
          START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. In 2011,
          Obama ordered military involvement in Libya in order to implement UN
          Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of
          Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the counterterrorism raid that killed
          Osama bin Laden.
